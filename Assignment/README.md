## This code is for the basic inner workings of a calculator

math.c supports an input of two numbers and an operator. The operator can be '+' for addition, '-' for subtraction, '*' for multiplication, '/' for division, or '%' for modulus.
The function will return the outcome of the desired operator. It will also return 0 if the operator entered is invalid.
